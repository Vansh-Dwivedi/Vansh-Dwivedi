Hi there 👋, I'm Vansh Dwivedi!

👨‍💻 At just 9 years old, I've already dived deep into the world of programming and have built websites and apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I'm also learning PHP and SQL to expand my development skills.

🎭 When I'm not coding, you might find me acting—a passion I've pursued since I was 3!

🕹️ Fun fact: I started exploring Minecraft developer mode when I was just 5, which sparked my interest in technology.

🌱 I’m currently exploring more about web technologies and looking to start new projects. Stay tuned for what's coming next!

📫 You can reach me here on GitHub. Let's collaborate and make something awesome!
